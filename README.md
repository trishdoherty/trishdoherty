- 👋 Hi, I’m @trishdoherty
- 👀 I’m interested in where UX design, conversational design, and delightful content intersect.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about writing for chatbots and AI conversational design.
- 💞️ I'd love to find the best and most innovative conversation designers on github to follow.  If you have someone to recommend, please do. I'm an experienced writer, but when it comes to writing for AI, I'm green!
- 📫 How to reach me: trish@trishdoherty.net
